                <div id="it24j-3-2-2-3-2-2-4-3-9">The purpose behind our AI technology development focuses on delivering
                  outcomes which maintain fairness while omitting prejudice between users. The systems driven by AI
                  technology such as Edysor AI, purposefully deliver results, but they occasionally sense errors and
                  latent biases and produce outputs that deviate from intended specifications. The learning capabilities
                  of machine learning models extract patterns from sizable data collections, yet no computer system can
                  ensure faultless execution throughout every scenario.<br />Potential for Errors<br />Automated voice
                  interpretation happens with reasonable accuracy yet service users will sometimes experience
                  translation and interpretation errors or misunderstandings.<br />Users recognise that artificial
                  intelligence may generate misunderstandings of actual world facts or specialised domain
                  specifications.<br />Unintended Biases<br />We operate an ongoing training procedure and auditing
                  mechanism to reduce bias in our systems. The generation of biases occurs through the unpredictable
                  combination of training data constraints and the natural complexities both within cultural contexts
                  and speech communication systems.<br />As a protection measure, Edysor AI disclaims legal
                  responsibility for damages that result from potential errors or biases found in AI-generated
                  output.<br />No Guarantee of 100% Accuracy<br />The AI-powered voice interaction service Edysor AI
                  provides automation yet does not offer absolute reliability combined with accuracy nor adherence to
                  policies or legislative and rule frameworks.<br />The outputs are provided “as is,” and you agree that
                  any decisions or actions taken based on AI-generated content are your sole
                  responsibility.<br />Disclaimer of Liability for Commitments or Statements<br />During AI bot
                  interactions, Edysor Technologies Pvt. Ltd. assumes no responsibility for statements and commitments
                  made by its AI bot. Throughout the AI interaction, you will understand that all automated text outputs
                  have no legal force to create contractual or legally binding commitments for the company.<br />Make
                  independent decisions about the reliability of AI information because crucial business and legal
                  details need experienced human evaluation.<br />Assumption of Risk<br />The use of all AI-generated
                  results' potential inaccuracies and unreliability risks becomes your responsibility when you utilise
                  the services.<br />You need to verify information whenever you have doubts about accuracy or legal
                  compliance through independent means before taking action on the information.<br />If you do not

                  with the limitations outlined above, you must discontinue the use of Edysor AI immediately.</div>

                  elaboration on key matters such as AI fairness, potential biases, user conduct expectations, and more.
                  This elaboration is intended to reinforce clarity, so Users engage with the platform under
                  well-defined parameters. While some of these points reiterate or expand upon earlier sections, they
                  are included here to give additional context and depth.<br /><br /><b>21.1 AI Fairness and Potential
                    Biases</b><br id="i2nu1nt" draggable="true" /><br id="ikrkszt" draggable="true" />Edysor AI’s AI
                  models learn from diverse datasets compiled from various sources. We actively curate, cleanse, and
                  refine these datasets to eliminate hateful, discriminatory, or otherwise problematic language.
                  However, since no dataset is perfect, partial biases may persist.<br id="i698j51"
                    draggable="true" />We conduct periodic audits of the AI outputs to identify patterns indicating
                  possible bias. Despite these measures, some biases might remain undetected. Such biases could affect
                  the model’s responses, especially in complex or context-specific queries.<br id="iwfbhzm"
                    draggable="true" />Continuous Improvement<br id="izt7oxm" draggable="true" />We welcome feedback
                  from users regarding any suspected bias or inaccuracies in the responses. Such community-driven
                  feedback is critical in refining the models and training processes.<br id="i518dbl"
                    draggable="true" />Edysor AI invests in research and development to advance interpretability tools,

                  call automation or voice-based engagements. It is not intended to serve as a substitute for
                  professional advice in specialised fields such as law, finance, or medicine.<br id="i3pikbf"

                  potential violations, such as harassment or hateful content.<br id="iu9d3e9" draggable="true" />The

                  the rules and will lead to stiff legal consequences for users.<br id="imoozah" draggable="true" />We
                  proactively monitor high-volume activities. The detection of suspicious behavior might result in

                  Customizations<br id="ig9ry3p" draggable="true" />Certain businesses might need customised AI models
                  alongside unique, specific customisation options. When specialised features or models are required,
                  enterprise agreements create details about service level commitments and support services and
                  liability allocation.<br id="icvz4vk" draggable="true" />Custom agreements about specific services
                  take precedence over conflicting clauses in these Terms when applied to custom services mentioned

                    id="ipoa5il" draggable="true" />Enterprise-level organisations should fill out strong data

                  customers receiving voice-based services, you confirm that you received their explicit consent to let
                  your system process their data or that you have alternative lawful grounds for this data
                  processing.<br id="iz2lfro" draggable="true" />Limitations on Legal Claims<br id="ieu6ivu"
                    draggable="true" />Any legal disputes must be brought within a certain timeframe. You agree that, to
                  the extent permitted by law, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the
                  Services or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or
                  be forever barred.<br id="ikrzzt9" draggable="true" />This shortened limitation period reflects the
                  rapid pace of AI evolution and ensures timely resolution of any controversies.<br id="ipfrto6"
                    draggable="true" />Technical Support Boundaries<br id="igw8o1r" draggable="true" />Edysor AI may
                  offer technical or customer support through various channels. While we strive to be helpful and
                  responsive, the user remains solely responsible for customizing, maintaining, and securing their own
                  systems that interface with the Services.<br id="i025igk" draggable="true" />Edysor AI does not
                  guarantee resolution times or outcomes for technical issues unless explicitly stated in a separate
                  service-level agreement (SLA).<br id="ib97nxu" draggable="true" />Uptime and Service-Level Goals<br
                    id="i2yhvmf" draggable="true" />Edysor AI aims for high availability but does not promise 100%
                  uptime. Planned maintenance windows, unscheduled disruptions, force majeure events, or third-party
                  outages may result in temporary service unavailability.<br id="iabeott" draggable="true" />No SLA
                  credits or refunds will be provided unless separately negotiated in writing as part of a higher-tier
                  enterprise agreement.<br id="iv9wkpj" draggable="true" />Feedback Loops and Model Training<br
                    id="im7evds" draggable="true" />As part of your usage, you may receive system prompts requesting
                  feedback or evaluations. Providing this feedback helps train and refine the AI models. You grant
                  Edysor AI the right to use the feedback for model improvement.<br id="i00hhr4" draggable="true" />We
                  anonymize or pseudonymize user data for such training whenever feasible, aiming to safeguard personal
                  information.<br id="imhiz4k" draggable="true" />Fair Use of Resources<br id="i9147hh"
                    draggable="true" />Edysor AI employs a fair use policy to prevent misuse of system resources,
                  including excessive API calls, bandwidth usage, or storage consumption. If your usage surpasses normal
                  operational thresholds and places an undue burden on our systems, we may limit or suspend your account
                  to preserve service quality for other users.<br id="ikw70rt" draggable="true" />Survival and
                  Post-Termination Consequences<br id="ixhb4d5" draggable="true" />Even after termination, certain
                  obligations of the users and protections for Edysor AI remain in force. These include (but are not
                  limited to) the disclaimers of warranties, limitations of liability, and indemnification clauses.<br
                    id="ibtbqts" draggable="true" />Your data may be irretrievable after termination. You are encouraged
